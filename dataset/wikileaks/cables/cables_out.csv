ON NOVEMBER 15, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT     OF ZIMBABWE AND THE DELIVERY OF A DIPLOMATIC NOTE TO THE     MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, THE EMBASSY ANNOUNCED THE     TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF THE PEACE CORPS PROGRAM IN     ZIMBABWE.  FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF THAT ANNOUNCEMENT.  THE     LANGUAGE IN THE PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT FOLLOWED VERY CLOSELY     THAT OF THE DIPLOMATIC NOTE.    2.   BEGIN TEXT OF PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT: FOLLOWING     CONSULTATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE, AND WITH     GREAT REGRET, THE U.S. EMBASSY ANNOUNCES THE TEMPORARY     SUSPENSION OF THE PEACE CORPS PROGRAM IN ZIMBABWE.  THE     EMBASSY REGRETS THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE\'S FAILURE TO     PROVIDE WORK PERMITS FOR VOLUNTEER TEACHERS, AS STIPULATED     IN THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE AND THE     PEACE CORPS, FOLLOWING A THREE-MONTH TRAINING PERIOD IN     ZIMBABWE FOR THE VOLUNTEERS IN QUESTION.  BECAUSE OF THE     LONG LEAD-TIME NEEDED FOR SELECTION AND TRAINING OF     QUALIFIED VOLUNTEERS TO FILL THE SPECIALIZED POSITIONS, THE     EMBASSY REQUIRES ASSURANCES THAT THE TRAINEES SELECTED IN     CONSULTATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT     THEIR WORK.    ABSENT SUCH ASSURANCES, THE EMBASSY BELIEVES IT IS PRUDENT  TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND PEACE CORPS OPERATIONS IN ZIMBABWE.  THE EMBASSY AND THE PEACE CORPS HOPE TO CONSULT FURTHER  WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE AT A MUTUALLY AGREED FUTURE  DATE ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF RESUMING WHAT HAS BEEN A  MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PEOPLE OF  ZIMBABWE AND THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES.
